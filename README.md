# IntlFcStoneCodeChallenge

Scope:
Develop a RESTful API that would allow a web or mobile front-end to:  
● Create a contact record  
● Retrieve a contact record  
● Update a contact record  
● Delete a contact record  
● Search for a record by email or phone number  
● Retrieve all records from the same state or city  
The contact record should represent the following information: name, company, profile image, email,
birthdate, phone number (work, personal) and address.
Also please provide a unit test for at least one of the endpoints you create.

Notes:
Feel free to make whatever assumptions you need to about required fields, data formats and
validations; document whatever assumptions you make. The data can be persisted in whatever
persistence layer that you want.
